# Migrating to Minimal API

This is a practical phase, refer to project [ResetApiCourse](RestApiCourse.sln) for more details.

**Topics covered:**

- What are Minimal APIs?
- Creating the new endpoint structure
- Migrating movie retrieval
- Migrating movie creation
- Migrating movie listing
- Migrating movie update
- Migrating movie deletion
- Migrating rating endpoints
- Migrating Auth
- Updating Swagger
- Updating versioning
- Updating output cache

> Recap: Migration to Minimal APIs from Web API is pretty easy. The path is laid down for us, restructuring isn't too hard, everything can be used and ultimately, as an opinion, it leads to better structure and more focused structure, and more tidy structure. Things like auth, swagger, versioning, output cache, etc. can be migrated very very easily. There's alternatives. And whether you're gonna go with minimal APIs or web APIs, it's up to you. But the migration path is pretty easy.
