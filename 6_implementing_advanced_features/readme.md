> Recap: We tackled filtering, sorting, and pagination, the holy trinity of doing actions with the endpoints. We talked about HATEOS and why it is not liked, but also can have to them whoever wants if any. There's a way to implement it and its very easy to do. We added both basic and advanced versioning using both a traditional approach and a NuGet package. We explained what swagger is and what OpenAPI is and how we can mix them together to provide a better documentation experience for our user using both versioning and descriptive models. We added health checks to make sure the application is running successfully and traffic can be handled. We added output caching and response caching and we can choose between the two or have both of them in. And we talked about API key based authentication and mix on authentication.
