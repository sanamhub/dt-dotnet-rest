**Topics covered:**

- Authentication and Authorization in REST APIs

> Recap: We understood what authentication and authorization is and the differences between the two. We saw how auth works in a REST API context, especially with the whole stateless concept. Utilizing the fake identity service, which is used to generate token even for own purposes to play with implementing auth in the services. We saw how we can properly validate the token in REST API. And also limit the token based on claims on the token itself, for example: admin, trusted user, etc
